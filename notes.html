                - "deep sea" vs secrets/thoughts/insights</li>
                <li>Using parallax scrolling<br>
                - imitate going deeper, gaining depth, also a changing background to reflect it<br>
            also having some weird complex text scrolling things where<br> submissions could scroll across the screen like you were moving<br>
            - probably on an "observation deck" room</li>
            <li>figure out what the different rooms are gonna do</li>
            <li>RESEARCH ROOM: generative js? weird ocean facts? link to an article?</li>
            <li>STORAGE ROOM: sources? dev notes?</li>
            <li>ENGINE ROOM: still thinking<br>
            - considering what drives the ship forward<br>
            - what gives power?</li>
            <li>CONTROL ROOM: maybe going up and down to see new confessions<br>
            in observation, will allow to go "deeper"<br>
            - link to seperate observationBottom.html</li>

            POSSIBLE ROOMS:

                <li>building up the rooms</li>
                <li>gotta draw all the assets</li>
