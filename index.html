            <ul>
            <li>We dive into an anonymous confession board:<br>
            - "deep sea" vs secrets/thoughts/insights</li>
            <li>Using parallax scrolling<br>
            - imitate going deeper, gaining depth, also a changing background to reflect it<br>
        also having some weird complex text scrolling things where<br> submissions could scroll across the screen like you were moving<br>
        - probably on an "observation deck" room</li>
        </ul> 
        POSSIBLE ROOMS:
        <ul>
            <li>building up the rooms</li>
            <li>gotta draw all the assets</li>
            <li>still figuring out how to gather the data</li>
        </ul>
