        <h1>Welcome to a research sub!</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>An anonymous confession board<br>
            - "deep sea" vs secrets/thoughts/insights</li>
            <li>Using parallax scrolling<br>
            - imitate going deeper, gaining depth, also a changing background to reflect it<br>
        also having some weird complex text scrolling things where submissions could scroll across the screen like you were moving<br>
        - probably on an "observation deck" room</li>
        </ul> 
        POSSIBLE ROOMS:
        <ul>
            <li>communication room (where people can submit)</li>
            <li>observation deck (the scrolling) in the actual ocean</li>
            <li>homePage (navigation room)</li>
            <li>various rooms (where you can spot some confessions out the window, fun ocean facts)</li>
            <li>engine room</li>
            <li>research room</li>
        </ul>
