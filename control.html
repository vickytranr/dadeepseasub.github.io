            <p>Welcome aboard this anonymous deep sea research vessel.<br>
            A couple housekeeping rules, and you can be on your way.<br><br>
            It might take you a while to find your sea legs, but maps<br>in the STAIRWELLS and NAVIGATION ROOM will help<br>
            you find your way. Feel free to explore the ship and<br>
            see the kinds of things we get up to around here.<br><br>
            I'd recommend the COMMUNICATION, where you can<br>
            broadcast whatever you please into the open sea, and the<br>
            OBSERVATION DECK, where you can look through our periscope<br>
            and see what anyone else has broadcasted.</p>
